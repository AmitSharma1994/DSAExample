◄ Array / String Inputs

	1. Is the array sorted? 
            → Think Use Binary Search, Two Pointers, or Prefix Sums

	2. Optimization problems (Max/Min/Subarray)? 
	        → Think Sliding Window, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy

	3. Looking for duplicates / counts / frequencies? 
	        → Use HashMap, HashSet, or Counting Array

	4. Need substrings or fixed-size subarrays? 
        	→ Think to Apply Sliding Window with Two Pointers

	5. Frequent min/max in window? 
	    → Use Monotonic Queue, Deque, or Heap

	6. Generating subsets, permutations, combinations? 
         → Use Backtracking

	7. Matching / parsing characters? 
	    → Use Stack, especially for Balanced Parentheses, Infix/Postfix

◄ Graph Inputs

	1. Shortest path in unweighted graph? 
	        → Use Breadth-First Search (BFS)

	2. Weighted shortest path? 
        	→ Use Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, or A\

	3. Connected components / cycle detection? 
	        → Use DFS, Union-Find (DSU)

	4. Topological ordering? 
	    → Use Kahn’s Algorithm or DFS + visited set

	5. Optimization like MST? 
	    → Use Kruskal or Prim’s Algorithm

◄ Tree Inputs (Often Binary Trees)

	1. Traversals? 
	    → Use Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, or Level-order (BFS)

	2. Balanced checks or diameter calculations? 
	   → Use Postorder + height calculations

	3. Lowest Common Ancestor? 
	   → Use Recursive DFS or Parent Map + Ancestor Set

◄ Linked List Inputs

	1. Detecting cycles? 
	  → Use Slow and Fast Pointers (Floyd’s Algorithm)

	2. Reversals / partial changes? 
	    → Use pointer juggling: prev, curr, next

	3. Intersection or middle node? 
	    → Use Two Pointers

◄ Dynamic Programming Use-Cases

	1. Optimal choices / Overlapping subproblems? 
	    → Use DP with Memoization (Top Down) or Tabulation (Bottom Up)

	2. Subset or knapsack problems? 
	    → Use 1D/2D DP Arrays

	3. String matching or edits? 
	 → Use DP Matrix (e.g., Edit Distance, LCS)

◄ Range Queries / Updates

	1. Many sum queries, no updates? 
	   → Use Prefix Sums

	2. Many sum queries + updates? 
	  → Use Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

◄ Bit Manipulation

	1. Set-based subsets or XOR logic? 
	→ Use Bit Masks or XOR

	2. Need to check even/odd, set/unset bits? 
	→ Use `&`, `|`, `^`, `>>`, `<<` operators

◄ When Recursion is Banned or Stack Overflow Risk

	→ Convert to Iterative using Stack

◄ Top K / Least K Elements

	→ Use Heap 
	→ For exact K-th value, use Quick Select

◄ Special Techniques

	Sliding Window → For subarray with fixed or dynamic size 
	Monotonic Stack → Next Greater / Smaller Element 
	Greedy → Only when local optimum leads to global optimum 
	Trie → For prefix-based string problems
